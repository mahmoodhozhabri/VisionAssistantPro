## Changes for 5.0
* **Multi-Provider Architecture**: Added full support for **OpenAI**, **Groq**, and **Mistral** alongside Google Gemini. Users can now choose their preferred AI backend.
* **Advanced Model Routing**: Users of native providers (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.) can now select specific models from a dropdown list for different tasks (OCR, STT, TTS).
* **Advanced Endpoint Configuration**: Custom provider users can manually input specific URLs and model names for granular control over local or third-party servers.
* **Smart Feature Visibility**: The settings menu and Document Reader UI now automatically hide unsupported features (like TTS) based on the selected provider.
* **Dynamic Model Fetching**: The addon now fetches the available model list directly from the provider's API, ensuring compatibility with new models as soon as they are released.
* **Hybrid OCR & Translation**: Optimized the logic to use Google Translate for speed when using Chrome OCR, and AI-powered translation when using Gemini/Groq/OpenAI engines.
* **Universal "Re-scan with AI"**: The Document Reader's re-scan feature is no longer limited to Gemini. It now utilizes whatever AI provider is currently active to re-process pages.
